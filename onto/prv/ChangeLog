Version 0.1 (September 2010)
============================
 * ADDED: prv:PropertyReification - the class, which describes the relations of a property reification. That means, its "shortcut 
          relation", its reification class, and the properties that are relating to the subject and object of the "shortcut relation"
 * ADDED: prv:shortcut - relates to the property of the "shortcut relation" (its predicate)
 * ADDED: prv:reification_class - relates to the reification class, which can be related to the object and subject property to be able 
          to associate the object and subject of the "shortcut relation". The reification class should provide detailed descriptions of 
          the relationship that is described in a simple form by the "shortcut relation"
 * ADDED: prv:subject_property - relates to the property of the reification class, which relates to the subject of the "shortcut 
          relation"
 * ADDED: prv:shortcut_property - elates to the property of the reification class,  which relates to the predicate of the "shortcut 
          relation". So that the specific property reification can be "verified" (the property of the prv:shortcut relation and this 
          one associated by the referred shortcut property should be equal)
 * ADDED: prv:object_property - relates to the property of the reification class, which relates to the object of the "shortcut relation"
