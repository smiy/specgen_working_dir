This is the [SpecGen](https://github.com/zazi/specgen) working directory for all [SMI](http://smiy.org/) ontologies and vocabularies, i.e., all ontology and vocabulary specification documentations are generated with the help of this [SpecGen tool](https://github.com/zazi/specgen).

The plain templates and ontology/vocabulary specifications can be found in the subfolders of the [onto](https://github.com/smiy/specgen_working_dir/tree/master/onto) folder.
The enriched documents will usually be stored in the subfolder of the [spec](https://github.com/smiy/specgen_working_dir/tree/master/spec) folder.
